# Welcome

TIY Front-End Engineering repo for Week 6 cross class group project.

## Usage

This template contains some simple `gulp` tasks. They are as follows:

- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task.

- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while

- `gulp handlebars`: This will compile your handlebars (`.hbs`) files for you. Again, `watch` will watch for changes, but if you add new files, you'll need to run this or restart the `gulp watch` command.

## Installed fonts + frameworks

- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome

# Workflow

Clone down the repo. Run:

- `npm install`

- `bower install`

# Check out a new dev branch:

- `git checkout -b` [custom branch name, easily recognizable as you]

Consistently pull down from remote dev. Commit often, so you can easily write your commit messages and summarize your work. Inform your fellow devs when you are pushing to dev. Do not push up code that does not pass our gulp watcher. If you run into a merge conflict that's more than a simple line of css or a line spacing issue, communicate it to your fellow devs and decide together what's the best route to take.

# DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER.
